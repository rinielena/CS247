        <p>So you and your friend have decided to sign up for friendSHIP. Well, how does this work? Let's dive right in.</p>
        <p>Now that you've finished signing up, you'll have the option to pick longer or shorter reflection notifications and how often you would like to receive them.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>Short reflection notifications will remind you to take some time to write down some of your thoughts and reflections. You'll want to start by getting a notebook or journal of your choice.</p>
        <p>Every so often (according to your preferences), we will send you a prompt through text of something to write down in your journal.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>The journal prompts will start off with questions regarding your friendship and then delve deeper into your own principles and values. This will help you connect some thoughts and reflect on what is important to you.</p>
        <p>Once you've finished your short reflection, congratulate yourself by ticking off a check mark. We'll send you the link through the notification.</p>

        <p>Keep track of you and your friend's progress as you go along to see how many short reflections you've both completed.</p>
        <p>Now comes the fun part. When it's time to have a longer conversation with your friend, we'll remind you to take some time to reflect on your journal entries. Once you're both done reflecting, then it's time to plan your talk.</p>
