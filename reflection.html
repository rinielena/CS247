            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>It's time to reflect on how your relationship has been going lately and get ready to talk about it.</p>

            <h4>Before you begin:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Be sure you've set aside enough time to think through your experiences without rushing. A half hour to an hour should be plenty.</li>
                <li>We recommend writing down your thoughts and responses to these questions. It can help you to process them more thoroughly and can also be a useful reference when trying to talk about these things in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ready? Let's start reflecting.</h4>
            <br />
        </div>

        <div id="thoughts">
            <h4>First, let's go over what's been happening lately.</h4>
            <p>Go back over any notes you may have made about your relationship with your friend, either in your journal or somewhere else.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Do you notice any trends? Any issues that have come up more than once, or any good things you've noticed reoccurring?</li>
                <li> Try to pick out up to three things that seem to be going well and three things that could be going better. For each constructive piece of feedback you have, try to come up with at least one thing that you appreciate about your relationship.</li>
                <li> What are some things you're proud of having done for or with your friend lately? What are some things that you could do on your end to be a better friend?</li>
                <li> For each issue you've noted, why do you think it's bothering you? What might fix it? Try to come up with multiple possible solutions.</li>
                <li>What other things have been going on in your life, either positively or negatively, that might be affecting your relationship?</li>
            </ul>

            <br />

            <h4>Now, let's do some more general self-reflection.</h4>
            <p>Take a look at your journal entries about other relationships in your life, books, and movies. You can also draw on any other sources that come to mind.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Are there any recurring features that you seem to value in your relationships? How are they expressed in your friendSHIP relationship?</li>
                <li> How about traits that seem to bother you consistently? Why might that be?</li>
                <li> Do these insights connect to any of the points you noted before about your friendSHIP relationship?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br />

        <div id="questions">
            <h4>Now that you've thought about your experiences, let's start looking forward to talking with your friend.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Come up with some goals. Is there anything that you feel needs to change between you and your friend? Anything you want to ask them about or make sure they understand?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure these goals are things that will be productive towards improving your relationship in the future. It might feel good at the time to vent, receive an apology, and move on, but that doesn't always go very far towards making sure that the same situation doesn't happen again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is the worst way you can imagine your friend reacting to what you have to say? How might you handle that situation?</li>
                <li>What is the best way your friend might react? What would that situation be like?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remember that these are only guesses - the only way to know for sure what your friend thinks is to ask them!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
