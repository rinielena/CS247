            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>It's time to reflect on how your relationship has been going lately and get ready to talk about it. We've reviewed the literature and pulled out some of the ideas that we think will be most helpful for you.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <h4>Before you begin:</h4>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Be sure you've set aside enough time to think through your experiences without rushing. A half hour to an hour should be plenty.</li>
                <li>We recommend writing down your thoughts and responses to these questions, in a notebook or some other physical place. Handwriting your thoughts can help you to process them more thoroughly and can also be a useful reference when trying to talk about these things in the future.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Ready? Let's start reflecting.</h4>
            <br />
        </div>

        <div id="thoughts">
            <h4>First, let's go over what's been happening lately.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Go back over any notes you may have made, either in your notebook or somewhere else. Do you notice any trends? Any issues that have come up more than once, or any good things you've noticed reoccurring? Try to pick out up to three things that seem to be going well and three things that could be going better.</li>
                <li>For each constructive piece of feedback you have, try to come up with at least one thing that you appreciate about your relationship.</li>
                <li>What are some things that you could do on your end to be a better friend?</li>
                <li>What are some things you're proud of having done lately?</li>
                <li>If there are some things that have been bothering you lately in your relationship, why do you think they're bothering you? What do you wish your friend did differently? What could you do differently?
                    <ul>
                        <li>For each of these issues, try to come up with multiple possible solutions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <br />

        <div id="questions">
            <h4>Now that you've thought about your experiences, let's start looking forward to your conversation with your friend.</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Come up with some goals for this conversation. Is there anything that you feel needs to change between you and your friend? Is there anything that you want to do differently? Anything you want to ask them about, or make sure they know about how you've been feeling?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make sure these goals are things that will be productive towards improving your relationship in the future. In particular, if there's anything about which you're feeling resentful, try to focus on solutions there might be to the issue going forward. It might feel good at the time to vent, receive an apology, and move on, but that doesn't always go very far towards making sure that the same situation doesn't happen again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What is the worst way you can imagine your friend reacting to what you have to say? How might you handle that situation?</li>
                <li>What is the best way your friend might react? What would that situation be like?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remember that these are only guesses - the only way to know for sure what your friend thinks is to ask them!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Set up a time to have a conversation with your friend. See <a href="materials.html#walking">our page of advice</a> for more information about what might be the best environment for a discussion.</li>
                <li>Keep an open mind. You don't know what your friend might have to say, but one of the best ways to help your points be well-received is to make sure that their points will be well-received in return. Be ready to accept fault and change your behavior if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
