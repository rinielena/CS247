				<h3>Conversation Mindset</h3>
				<p>These are some additional ideas to keep in mind while having a longer conversation, especially for conversations that might be emotional.</p>

				<ul class="no-bullet">

					<li>
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#be-interested">Be Interested</button>
						<div id="be-interested" class="collapse out">
							<p class="blurb">Conversations flow when you are curious about the person you are
		talking to. No one likes to speak to someone who is not listening. So,
		be sure to smile, make eye contact, ask follow-up questions, and be
		present.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>What has changed in your life since the last time we spoke?  </li>
								<li>What have you wanted to share with someone, but no one has asked you about it yet?</li>
								<li>What have you been doing for fun lately?</li>
								<li>What plans do you have in the works?</li>
							</ul>
							<p class = "inspiration">"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."</p>
						</div>
					</li>
				
					<li>
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#appreciate">Appreciate</button>
						<div id="appreciate" class="collapse out">
							<p class="blurb">Appreciation whether through a compliment or another form of
		recognition can go a long way. It takes little effort to notice
		something someone has put a lot of effort into.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>I really liked how today...</li>
								<li>I thought of you when...</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="inspiration">"Once I did bad and that I heard ever. Twice I did good, but that I heard never."</p>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#understanding">Gaining Understanding</button>
						<div id="understanding" class="collapse out">
							<p class="blurb">Don’t assume you know what is on another person’s mind. Ask them and
		know for sure. Only when you understand can you move forward.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Help me understand why you feel the way you do.</li>
								<li>What do you want from this conversation?</li>
							</ul>
							<p class = "inspiration">“Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn’t think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or grasshopper in front of the fish and said: "Wouldn't you like to have that?"Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?” </p>		
					  </div>
					</li>
		 
		 			<li>
						<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#reactions">Unforseen Reactions</button>
						<div id="reactions" class="collapse out">
							<p class="blurb">You can't predict exactly how somebody else is going to react to anything, much as you might try. This can make many things scary, especially when you imagine them reacting horribly to something you do or say. Just remember that all you can control is yourself. You can consider what you might do in a couple of scenarios, but ultimately, their actions are their own.</p>
							
							<p class="inspiration">"Learning that you can’t control the other person’s reaction, and that it can be destructive to try, can be incredibly liberating. It not only gives the other person the space to react however they need to, but also takes a huge amount of pressure off you. You will learn things about yourself based on their reaction, but if you are prepared to learn, you’ll feel free from the desperate need for their reaction to go one certain way."</p>
				  	</div>
				  </li>
		   
			   <li>
				 		<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#forgiveness">Forgiveness</button>
			      <div id="forgiveness" class="collapse out">
			      	<p class="blurb">It always feels horrible when a friend is angry at you. The first step towards receiving forgiveness for anything you've done is giving that forgiveness yourself. You and your friend will both feel better for it.</p>
			 				
			 				<p class="inspiration">"Any fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving."</p>		
			 		  </div>
			 		</li>

			<div class="activities">
			<h3>Activities</h3>
			<p>If you're looking for some ideas for activities to help you and your friend express what's on your mind, try these out!</p>

			<ul class="no-bullet">
				<li>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#survey">Hypothetical Survey</button>
		      <div id="survey" class="collapse out">
		      	<p class="blurb">Do you often wonder how your friend would react if you brought up a difficult subject with them? To have a better idea of this, you could create a survey of hypothetical scenarios to which each of you write in how you would react and share with each other. This will help you each of you understand how the other would react to various situations and the reasoning behind their actions.</p>
		 		  </div>
		 		</li>

		 		<li>
		 		  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#madlibs">Madlibs</button>
		      <div id="madlibs" class="collapse out">
		      	<p class="blurb">This is similar to the hypothetical scenarios survey, but with a fun twist. Create Madlibs of situations you and your friend may find yourselves in. Fill in the blanks with how you would feel and what actions you would take. </p>
		 		  </div>
		 		</li>

		 		<li>
		 		  <button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#editor">Your Friend as Your Editor</button>
		      <div id="editor" class="collapse out">
		      	<p class="blurb">Sometimes you may think you know your friend, but they might behave and feel in a different way than you would have predicted. If you enjoy writing, you can write a short scene or story with your friend as the main character. After you're finished, let your friend edit the story with what they think they actually what have done in the situations you've put them in.</p>
		 		  </div>
		 		</li>

		 		<li>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cookie">A Critique With a Compliment</button>
		      <div id="cookie" class="collapse out">
		      	<p class="blurb">Since you'd like to establish a comfortable environment for you and your friend to give criticism to each other, you can exchange a compliment or something pleasant after each criticism you give each other. For instance, bake some cookies, and every time you critique your friend, give them a cookie.</p>
		 		  </div>
		 		</li>

		 		<li>
		 			<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" class = "topic" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#walking">Take a Walk</button>
				      <div id="walking" class="collapse out">
				      	<p class="blurb">Taking a walk can be a great way to give both of you a chance to talk about how you've been feeling lately and reflect on your relationship together. It can create an environment that fosters comfort and safety, creative thinking, and an adjustment in perspective, which will be great for talking through any difficult subjects.</p>
